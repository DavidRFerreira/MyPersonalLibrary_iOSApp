# My Public Library

## Description
MyPublicLibrary is an iOS app that allows you to manage your personal library by letting you keep track of the books you own.
You can also add information about the book, check if you already read the book or not and if you lent it to someone. 

## Note
Although the app is already working with it's basic functionalities, I'm still working on it in order to bring more and new things.  

## Technologies and Concepts Used
The data storage is built using the Realm database platform. <br /> 
The app can use the Google Books API in order to search and retrieve the book's information (other option is to manually insert the information).

To create this app I used: 
- CocoaPods: 
  - [RealmSwift](https://cocoapods.org/pods/RealmSwift)
  - [SwipeCellKit](https://cocoapods.org/pods/SwipeCellKit)
  - [Alamofire](https://cocoapods.org/pods/Alamofire)
  - [SwiftyJSON](https://cocoapods.org/pods/SwiftyJSON)
- MVC
- Storyboards
- [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books)
